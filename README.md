# ICA-Information-Theory

## Project Goal: 
This project aims to reproduce the ICA algorithm in the papers 
- *Independent component analysis: An introduction.* by Alaa Tharwat
- *Blind Source Separation of Underwater Acoustic Signal by Use of Negentropy-based Fast ICA Algorithm.* by Tu Shijie and Chen Hang.

Validation of the implemented algorithm will be carried out using a dataset crafted using the pyRoom library. This dataset will serve as a reliable benchmark for assessing the performance of our ICA algorithm across various scenarios.
