# ICA-Information-Theory

## Project Goal: 
The aim of this project is to implement and validate the Fast ICA algorithm based on Negentropy, as described in the papers: 
- *Independent component analysis: An introduction.* by Alaa Tharwat
- *Blind Source Separation of Underwater Acoustic Signal by Use of Negentropy-based Fast ICA Algorithm.* by Tu Shijie and Chen Hang.

We reproduce the core functionalities of the algorithm and evaluate its performance on a synthetic dataset generated using the pyRoom library. This custom dataset provides a controlled environment to assess the effectiveness of the implemented ICA algorithm under different mixing conditions.
